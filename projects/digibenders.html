        <h2 class="h4">Target Market</h2>
        <p class="h5">DigiBenders offers three core services: software development, branding, and digital marketing. Our focus is on the Canadian audience. In visualizing DigiBenders&#x27; target market, envision a scatter plot divided into four quadrants. On the horizontal axis, ranging from small to mid-size businesses, and on the vertical axis, from low to high budget. Our focus lies in addressing a prominent segment represented by a bold line. This line signifies our ideal clientele: small businesses with mid to high budgets, gradually transitioning towards mid-size businesses with comparatively modest budgets. This strategic alignment allows us to cater to enterprises seeking elevated services within their financial capacity, ensuring tailored solutions for varying business sizes and budget constraints.<br>‍<br>Our comprehensive market analysis revealed a strong and varied demand spanning multiple industries for our offered services. Specifically, within the sphere of software solutions, our findings indicate a compelling trend: <a href="https://www.canadianlawyermag.com/inhouse/news/general/more-than-half-of-canadian-businesses-plan-to-spend-more-on-tech-in-2023-study/372465" target="_blank" class="link">more than half of Canadian businesses</a> exhibit a proactive interest in acquiring tools that facilitate streamlined <a href="https://minutedock.com/academy/5-types-of-software-every-business-needs" target="_blank" class="link">management, efficient tracking, seamless communication, optimized sales processes, and effective marketing strategies.</a> This keen interest underscores a pivotal shift in business priorities towards integrated solutions that bolster productivity, enhance communication, and drive growth, aligning perfectly with our suite of offerings tailored to meet these evolving market needs.<br>‍<br>Within Canada&#x27;s business landscape, <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/sme-research-statistics/en/key-small-business-statistics/key-small-business-statistics-2021" target="_blank" class="link">small businesses constitute 67% of the total entities.</a> Among the top 10 challenges encountered by these enterprises, a notable focus is on branding, with four of these challenges directly associated with aspects of brand development and website. Within this cohort, an overwhelming 83.6% require assistance with their existing website, while 63.8% express the need for a completely new website. Additionally, 70.6% of these businesses seek enhancements in their brand identity, with 38.2% specifically requiring graphic design services to bolster their branding efforts. These figures stem from a <a href="https://www.elevate-next.com/blog/survey-results-highlight-the-top-6-challenges-for-small-businesses" target="_blank" class="link">comprehensive survey</a> that sheds light on the prevalent struggles faced by small enterprises, emphasizing the pronounced demand for improvements in branding-related elements such as websites and brand identity.<br><br>In 2022, digital marketing commanded a <a href="https://madeinca.ca/digital-marketing-canada-statistics/" target="_blank" class="link">substantial portion, specifically 68.3%</a>, of the overall expenditure dedicated to advertising initiatives.

        <h2 class="h4">Target Audiences</h2>
        <div target="_blank" class="h5 w-richtext">
          <p>We successfully identified the target audience through a comprehensive process. We conducted thorough market research, examining demographics, needs, and pain points in the digital agency and software development sector. Client analyses and competitor assessments helped pinpoint common traits among satisfied customers. Feedback and surveys from clients provided valuable insights. Detailed user personas represented diverse segments. Continuous monitoring of industry trends and testing marketing campaigns targeting different demographics ensured alignment with evolving preferences. This diligent approach enabled us to craft our branding for these 3 groups.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li><strong>SMBs, Startups or individuals:</strong> Targeting small to medium businesses, startups or individuals seeking digital solutions and branding support for online growth.</li>
            <li><strong>B2B:</strong> Catering to businesses requiring software development, marketing boost or branding for their products or customers.</li>
            <li><strong>E-commerce and Local Businesses:</strong> Providing e-commerce solutions and digital marketing support for online retailers and local businesses aiming to enhance digital visibility and engagement.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>We&#x27;re aiming to attract a crowd interested in tech, design, and modern software. To do this, our brand elements—like logos, colors, and messages—need traits that connect with particular groups. These traits should feel familiar and appealing to our target audience, making them think, &quot;This brand gets me!&quot; By using designs and language that resonate with people in these fields, we create a sense of belonging and understanding, drawing in those who share our interests and values in technology and design.</p>

        <h3 class="h5">CEO of DigiBenders Nikhil and I were involved in this project, we wanted to take time and make sure we explore all our options before making any creative calls. We began assembling images, colors, textures, and patterns, filtering those resonating with company attributes—innovative, modern, technical, and fun. This process aids in crafting the brand&#x27;s visual identity, steering choices on colors, fonts, imagery, and design direction. By offering a visual reference, the mood board aligns the brand&#x27;s aesthetic and tone, ensuring consistency. It acts as a compass, guiding the visual storytelling of the brand, encapsulating its essence of innovation, modernity, technical prowess, and a touch of fun. This curated collection serves as a foundation for cohesive and impactful design decisions across the brand&#x27;s digital landscape.</h3>

        <h2 class="h4">Colors</h2>
        <h3 class="h5">We initiated by compiling a comprehensive array of potential colors aligned with our brand&#x27;s essence. Subsequently, a meticulous process began, systematically eliminating hues based on their alignment with our target audience and brand attributes. Our criteria involved excluding colors that least resonated with company attributes and emphasizing contrasting combinations conducive to our identity. Ultimately, after refinement, three colors were selected, symbolizing our values and forming a harmonious palette suitable for a 60-30-10 ratio on our website design.</h3>

        <h3 class="h5">The logo holds immense significance in visual identity, often misunderstood as an explainer rather than an identifier. Our approach involved brainstorming basic icons resonating with attributes like coding, fun, modernity, software development, multitasking, and intelligence. Our aim was to craft a memorable, scalable, and symmetric shape, aiming to subtly hint at the company&#x27;s function if feasible. The intent was to create an identity mark that, while not explanatory, aligns with our brand attributes, serving as a recognizable and evocative symbol of our brand&#x27;s essence.</h3>

        <p class="h5">The octopus, esteemed for its intelligence, symbolizes multitasking with its many limbs (though not factual, it conveys the visual idea). Our goal was to depict the octopus straightforwardly, infusing it with a futuristic, tech-driven look. This choice aimed to showcase multitasking abilities, even if exaggerated for visual impact. Using the octopus as a metaphor, we aimed for a friendly and relatable representation, merging its inherent intelligence with a futuristic appeal. The concept aimed to illustrate the notion of handling multiple tasks simultaneously, offering a visually engaging and relatable symbol of efficiency and adaptability.<br><br>We selected an octopus-shaped lined graphic element cleverly concealing the coding sign &lt;/&gt; within it discreetly. This design was streamlined to achieve minimalism, ensuring scalability and symmetrical distribution while maintaining balanced whitespace. The refined graphic embodies versatility and visual harmony, concealing the coding symbol subtly within its form.<br><br>The text &quot;DIGIBENDERS&quot; was custom-crafted prioritizing optimal readability while steering clear of a corporate or mundane appearance. The design aimed for a distinct and engaging look, avoiding a dull or overly formal impression.</p>

        <h2 class="h4">Typography</h2>
        <p class="h5">For this brand, the ideal typeface should embody a balance of modernity and approachability. We were looking forward for slightly unique but easy to read sans-serif type feces to convey a contemporary and clean aesthetic, reflecting the tech-centric nature of the company. Focus on legibility, choosing a font that maintains clarity in various sizes and mediums. Incorporate subtle stylization or unique elements to infuse character while ensuring the overall look remains professional and easily recognizable across digital platforms and print materials.<br><br>We opted for IBM Plex Mono for headings because of its resemblance to interface fonts used in terminals and coding software. As for the body font, we chose Inconsolata. While visually akin to IBM Plex, Inconsolata offers simplified kerning, enhancing overall readability for content.<br></p>
